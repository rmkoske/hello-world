        <ul>
          <li>1935 - Corrigan applied to the Bureau of Air Commerce for permission to make a nonstop flight to Ireland. Permission was denied, mainly due to the condition of his plane.</li>
          <li>1935 - 1937 - Corrigan modified his plane and made multiple applications for his transatlantic flight.</li>
          <li>1937 - Increasingly strict regulations led to Corrigan's plane being denied a renewal of its license.</li>
          <li>9 July 1938 - Corrigan got an experimental license for his plane and flew it from California to New York</li>
          <li>16 July 1938 - Corrigan wanted to leave New York on a flight back to California. The airfield manager convinced him to wait until early morning, and advised him to not use the west-facing runway because it was over his office.</li>
          <li>17 July 1938, 5:45 am  - Corrigan departed New York and headed east</li>
          <li>17 July 1938, 3:45 pm (approximately)  - Corrigan noticed his feet were cold and sitting in a puddle of gasoline from a leaky fuel tank. He punched a hole in the fuselage with a screwdriver to let it drain away from the exhaust.</li>
          <li>18 July 1938 - Corrigan arrives in Dublin and realizes his mistake.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>  
    <p>Corrigan managed to fly east for 26 hours without ever noticing that he should have been heading into the setting sun but he was actually heading into the rising sun. In spite of this, Corrigan maintained that his trip to Dublin was truly an accident.</p>
    <p>You can watch historic footage of Corrigan shortly after the flight <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9Dd8G50dFQ" target="_blank">here</a> and decide what you think.</p>
