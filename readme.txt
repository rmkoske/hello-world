Originally this repo was one I made for practice with git-it, and then I needed a place to upload images for a project on FreeCodeCamp. 

So the plan is that I'll just use this repository for all that kind of thing.  I'm not entirely sure what makes sense, but there will be definitely image folders and possibly I'll upload copies of the final projects so everything is in one place.
